Abstract
========

This document describes the development and release schedule for
Python 2.7.  The schedule primarily concerns itself with PEP-sized
items.  Small features may be added up to and including the first beta
release.  Bugs may be fixed until the final release.

Update
======

The End Of Life date (EOL, sunset date) for Python 2.7 has been moved
five years into the future, to 2020.  This decision was made to
clarify the status of Python 2.7 and relieve worries for those users
who cannot yet migrate to Python 3.  See also PEP 466.

This declaration does not guarantee that bugfix releases will be made
on a regular basis, but it should enable volunteers who want to
contribute bugfixes for Python 2.7 and it should satisfy vendors who
still have to support Python 2 for years to come.

There will be no Python 2.8 (see PEP 404).
